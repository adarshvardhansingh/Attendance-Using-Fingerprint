# Student Attendence System using Fingerprint Recognition 
Student attendance system using fingerprint recognition is to 
provide an accurate and efficient way of tracking the attendance of students in 
educational institutions. The system aims to replace traditional attendance 
methods such as manual paper-based systems with a more secure and automated 
process that utilizes biometric data.
The test1, test2 files are main recognition file and other code files can be used for feature extraction.
Sample images are named as 1,2,3 with a result image.
An image for testing for all codes is there named as testimage.
Matching can be done using a Direct matching Algorithm.
An sample paper is also provided for matching algorithm.
